# bbcstyle
bbcstyle is a lightweight Python package that applies a BBC News-inspired visual theme to Matplotlib and Seaborn plots. It helps you create clean, publication-ready charts with consistent typography, minimalist gridlines, and optional source annotations or logos. Inspired by the R package bbplot, this theme is ideal for reports, dashboards, and data journalism.
