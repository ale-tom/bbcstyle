# Code of Conduct

We pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone.

We are committed to a welcoming and inclusive environment. Unacceptable behavior includes harassment, trolling, or discrimination of any kind.

Instances of abusive behavior may be reported privately to the maintainer (see repository “About” for contact) or via GitHub’s reporting tools. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

This policy is adapted from the Contributor Covenant.
